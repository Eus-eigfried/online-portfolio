    title: "Stampede Against Humans",
    description: "is a fast-paced Unity game developed during my first year as the final project for Object-Oriented Programming. Inspired by classic road-crossing gameplay, it challenges players to reach the goal while avoiding animal stampedes across seven levels with increasing difficulty. The project emphasizes object-oriented design principles and reflects early technical growth and creative experimentation.",
    learned: "Creating Stampede Against Humanity introduced me to practical game development and object-oriented design. I learned to write modular, reusable code using core OOP principles, gained hands-on experience with Unity and C#, and developed skills in game logic, collisions, and level progression. The project also taught me how to break down complex ideas, debug effectively, and appreciate the importance of clean, well-structured design.",

    title: "Alumni Management System",
    description: "is a full-stack web application developed in my third year as the final requirement for Software Design. It evolved from a basic CRUD task into a functional alumni record system, built using React, Python, Apache, and phpMyAdmin on a local host. The project gave me hands-on experience with full-stack development and understanding how frontend, backend, and data systems work together.",
    learned: "Building the Alumni Management System taught me how to design and implement a full-stack application using React, Python, and phpMyAdmin. I learned practical CRUD operations, client–server communication, and local host setup with XAMPP/ Apache, while gaining experience in software architecture, debugging, and full-stack problem-solving.",

    title: "Interactive Timeline in Computer History",
    description: "The Interactive Timeline in Computer History is a single-page React web application developed during my fourth year for Computer Architecture and Organization. It showcases major computing milestones through a clean, interactive design, presenting each with its name, year, description, and performance impact. The project emphasized clear structure, user interaction, and effective presentation of technical content, and it was my first experience deploying a website to a GitHub domain for public access.",
    learned: "Creating the Interactive Timeline in Computer History strengthened my React skills, particularly component-based design, state management, and dynamic rendering, while sharpening my front-end design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I also learned how to deploy a project to GitHub Pages, gaining experience with version control and public web deployment.",
